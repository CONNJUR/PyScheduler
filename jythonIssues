jython appears not to support Python2.6
	this means that the json module of the Python standard library can not be used by Jython
	to support json under Jython:
		I wrote a very simple module for json serialization (however -- not well-tested)
		to read json, I use python's eval
		there is a wrapper module that:
			tries to import json
			if that fails, it imports the myJSON
				which, however, is dangerous, as it uses eval to read in JSON-formatted strings
	
jython does not come with argparse; however, the argparse from the python2.7 standard library works under Jython
	the library just needs to be dropped into the Lib folder in the Jython installation folder

execution speed is MUCH slower -- some stuff seems to take on the order of 5 to 10 times as long under Jython
