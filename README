This is a command-line application for generating NMR non-uniform sample schedules.

Features:

  - implementations of a large collection of published and verified sampling algorithms
  - algorithms can be easily combined to produce complicated schedules quickly and efficiently
  - extensible -- additional algorithms can be easily added without disrupting existing code
  - non-uniform quadrature collection
  - supports multiple common output formats -- varian, bruker, and others
  - full suite of unit tests
  - embedded logging capabilities
