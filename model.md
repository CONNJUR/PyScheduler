a schedule consists of 1 or more points
	
a schedule has 1 or more dimensions
	
a point has a location, indicated by coordinates
	one coordinate in each dimension
	
within a schedule, each point's location is unique:  there can not be two points with the same location

a point has 1 or more quadrature components, describing which should be collected
	a point may have up to 2 ^ n quadrature components, where n is the number of dimensions of the schedule
	
a quadrature component consists of 'real or imaginary' pieces (R/I)
	one R/I for each dimension
	
for each point, each of the quadrature components is unique

a point can have a number of transients, describing how many times it is to be collected
